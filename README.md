# Power-Query-Mastery
I analyze a couple of different sample datasets to demonstrate my proficiency using Power Query in Excel.

In exercise 1, I utilize a messy dataset that pertains to a Employees, containing information such as Name, Department, Salary, Gender, etc. 

To clean the dataset, I use Power Query to remove blanks and nulls, filter out missing salary information, extract country information, etc. 
I then load the newly cleaned queried Employee dataset back into Excel.
From there, I perform analysis on the dataset, creating a pivot table with slicers. 

In exercise 2, I use web-scraping techniques to load Wikipedia information on India's population into Excel. 

To clean the dataset, I use Power Query to load internet information into a table, remove N/A's & errors, remove columns redudant columns, 
change data types, unpivot columns to get only the population data I want, and create a new column titled year via a function. 

In exercise 3, I aggregate five different projects into one file. 
To clean the dataset, I use Power Query to join all the projects together, remove unnecessary information, 
use a function to create a date column, and change data types among other things. 

In exercise 4, I utilize a messy dataset that pertains to Student Information, containing information like courses, teachers, credits, names, etc. 
To clean the dataset, I concatenate rows from two tables into a single table,
merge tables using a left outer join on Courses column, and change data types among other things.
